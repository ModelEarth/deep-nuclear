# Research Summary: Nuclear Desalination Using MED Technology

## Executive Summary

Converting existing coastal nuclear power plants into desalination facilities using Multi-Effect Distillation (MED) by capturing waste heat from cooling systems is a technically and economically viable approach. This document summarizes key research findings and implementation strategies.

## Key Research Findings

### 1. Waste Heat Recovery Potential

**Finding**: Approximately 67% (two-thirds) of nuclear reactor thermal power is currently lost through cooling towers and can be recovered for desalination.

**Evidence**:
- Nuclear reactors typically operate at ~33% thermal efficiency
- The remaining 67% is rejected as waste heat
- This waste heat can be captured without affecting electricity generation
- Low-temperature desalination systems can operate solely on waste heat from condensers

## Technical Specifications

### MED System Design Parameters

**Gain Output Ratio (GOR)**:
- Definition: Ratio of distillate produced to steam consumed
- Typical Range: 8-15 for MED systems
- Higher GOR = Better efficiency
- Depends on number of effects and temperature distribution

**Number of Effects**:
- Typical Range: 4-16 effects
- More effects = Higher efficiency but higher capital cost
- Optimal typically 8-12 effects

**Top Brine Temperature**:
- Typical Range: 50-90°C
- Higher temperature = Higher efficiency
- Limited by scaling and corrosion concerns
- Optimal typically 65-75°C

### Daily Fresh Water Production Formula

```
Daily Water (m³/day) = (Waste Heat × 24 × 3600 × GOR) / (Latent Heat × 1000)
```

Where:
- Waste Heat = Reactor Power (MWth) × 0.67
- GOR = Gain Output Ratio (8-15)
- Latent Heat = 2326 kJ/kg (at 70°C)
- 24 = Hours per day
- 3600 = Seconds per hour

### Example Calculation

For a 3000 MWth reactor:
- Waste Heat Available: 3000 × 0.67 = 2010 MWth
- MED GOR: 12
- Daily Production: (2010 × 24 × 3600 × 12) / (2326 × 1000)
- Result: ~1,000,000 m³/day (1 million cubic meters per day)
